            <p>I've owned all of the Dance Off releases from the beginning. It's my favorite workout
               video every morning. I have lost 12 pounds with very little modification of my diet.
               </p>
            <p>Dance Off just gets better with every release. The song tracks are great. There is
               a wonderful
               selection of new and old tracks from around the world; some obscure and others more
               popular, 
               including several that are in heavy rotation on the radio right now. Most tracks have
               several
               choreographic alternatives that can be unlocked by earning in-game dance points.

            <p>A so-so release of this well-established title. The user interface is improved and
               easier to use and
               game provides a few great songs, a few terrible ones, and several mediocre ones. The
               graphics are 
               beautiful and the sets are stunning and fun (without being distracting.)
               </p>
            <p>Where this release fails is in the choreography. The dances just aren't as much fun
               as the previous 
               titles. Many of the moves follow predictable patterns; they're stale and that's a
               big problem for a 
               dance game. I hope the next release improves the choreography because it's great in
               all other
               phases of the game.

            <p>I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and her friends. They had exhausted the
               songs from the
               earlier releases and looking for a new challenge. This release includes the most current
               songs with
               GREAT new moves. My daughter also likes the new format and is getting hours of fun
               (and exercise!) 
               out of the game.

            <p>If you've played any of the previous Dance Off release then you know what to expect
               from this fun
               game. New users: give it a try.  It's kind of goofy and a lot of fun and unlike other
               games, it's a
               great source of exercise for "couch potatoes. It's not just for kids; sneak in some
               exercise when your
               children are away.
               </p>
            <p>This new release works the same way as the previous entries in this series: select
               a song and follow the 
               animated dancers on the monitor; closely mimic their moves and gain points, fall off
               the routine and lose
               points. The songs focus on the current pop stars, but there are a few classic pop
               and rock standards from 
               the 70's, 60's, and 50's.
               </p>
            <p>Be sure to explore the World Dance mode where you can play with friends online.

            <p>The installation was buggy and kept crashing my gaming console. I spent several hours
