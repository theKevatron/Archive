            <p>I'm a big fan of this product. As great as Version 11 was, I think this version is
               more realistic and responsive. It's not perfect. I found the controller system still
               
               a bit too complicated. Muscle memory helps a bit, but it could still use some 
               improvement.
               </p>
            <p>But that's a minor complaint. Compared to other games on the market, this is a great
               game
               at a great price.
               </p>
            <p>The music I can take or leave. I know that some players really get into the sound
               track. To
               me it's a lot of noise and very repetitive. I recommend picking this game up, even
               if you own 
               Version 11. It's a substantial upgrade and well worth the price.

            <p>The game is great when I have the ball and can drive to the rim or dish for the quick
               3; but I hate 
               playing defense. The controls are difficult and unintuitive. Where's the fun when
               you go in for a jam and
               then see your opponent do the same to you because your feet are stuck in cement?
               </p>
            <p>And don't suggest that I go to Basketball Camp. That stuff sounds good but the tips
               and lessons don't
               translate well to game conditions.

            <p>I've been waiting for this release. It's a great game and you won't be able to stop
               playing. I would 
               recommend this game to the basketball fans, but really anyone can enjoy this one.

            <p>I was so looking forward to this release. I got about 10 games out of it and then
               my gaming console stopped reading
               the disk. The disk is clean and free of scratches. All of the other games are still
               working just fine.

            <p>It's fun but frustrating because you have to basically relearn all the controls and
               button combinations all over again. 
               Why did they have to change everything? The enhancements are only okay at best and
               distracting at worst. My son hates
               this release and just goes back to Version 11. Save your money and wait for Version
               13 (which might be a lucky number
               for a change.)
